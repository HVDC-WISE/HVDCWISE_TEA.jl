## Overview

HVDCWISE_TEA.jl is a Julia package to perform techno-economic analyses of HVDC expansion candidates for large scale, hybrid AC/DC power transmission networks.
A multi-period, hybrid AC/DC Optimal Power Flow problem is built in order to quantify the change is operational costs related to the HVDC expansion candidates.
The package builds upon the [PowerModels](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl), [PowerModelsMCDC](https://github.com/Electa-Git/PowerModelsMCDC.jl), [FlexPlan](https://github.com/Electa-Git/FlexPlan.jl) and [CbaOPF](https://github.com/Electa-Git/CbaOPF.jl) packages, using a similar structure.


## How to setup the environment to run the project?
To activate the virtual environment of this project, open a new terminal and enter the Julia REPL by typing:

```
julia
```
Upon successful entry, you should see the Julia REPL prompt:

```

               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.    
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.8.3 (2022-11-14)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release  
|__/                   |

julia>
```

Next, within the ***Julia REPL***, enter the package manager by typing:

]
You'll see the package manager prompt:
```
(@v1.8) pkg>
```
In the package manager prompt, activate the virtual environment by specifying the path to your HVDCWISE_TEA.jl project: 
```
activate my\personnal\path\to\HVDCWISE_TEA.jl
```
_Be sure to replace my\personnal\path\to\HVDCWISE_TEA.jl with the ***actual path*** to your HVDCWISE_TEA project._


Finally, within the ***package manager prompt***, run:
```
instantiate
```
This command installs the project dependencies. You are now ready to work within the activated virtual environment.
