## Overview

HVDCWISE_TEA.jl is a Julia package to perform techno-economic analyses of HVDC expansion candidates for large scale, hybrid AC/DC power transmission networks.
A multi-period, hybrid AC/DC Optimal Power Flow problem is built in order to quantify the change is operational costs related to the HVDC expansion candidates.
The package builds upon the [PowerModels](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl), [PowerModelsMCDC](https://github.com/Electa-Git/PowerModelsMCDC.jl), [FlexPlan](https://github.com/Electa-Git/FlexPlan.jl) and [CbaOPF](https://github.com/Electa-Git/CbaOPF.jl) packages, using a similar structure.
